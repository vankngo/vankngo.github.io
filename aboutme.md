My name is Van Ngo. I enjoy getting insights from data to make efficient decisions and improvements. I gather information and analyze it even in my daily life. For example, before I decide to go out, I'd need to check the weather, the amount of time I will spend, the route to multiple locations, etc. to optimize my time and gas. In my spare time, I enjoy watching movies, working out or just reading news about the world around me!
